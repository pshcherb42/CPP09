## 3 compact programs in C++ 

## Exploring how STL and algoritms behave in real-world data processing

A set of small programs focused on data processing using STL containers.
The goal is to pick the most efficient algorithm for each specific exercise.
It includes performance-comparison scripts, some parsing logic, and the use of various algorithms.

## ex00 - BitCoin Exchange app

## A tiny C++98 tool that reads real Bitcoin prices and tells you how much your old transactions would be worth today.

This data-processing mini-project loads historical Bitcoin prices, parses user input, validates it, and finds the closest matching price in the dataset.

Here is the data that we are going to feed out program with:

The input file containing values that we need to convert and dates:
